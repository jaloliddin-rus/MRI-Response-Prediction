# MRI Prediction
This repository is to store the codes used for conference paper titled: Learning-Based MRI Response Predictions from OCT Microvascular Models to Replace Simulation-Based Frameworks [DOI: https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-66955-2_4].

CustomRegressor.py contains the modified version of MONAI's Regressor model, where we modified the last layer to ensure the output is between 0 and 1.

More details can be found in our paper.

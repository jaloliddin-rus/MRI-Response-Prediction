# MRI Prediction
This repository is to store the codes used for paper titled: 3D ResNets for MRI Response Prediction from OCT Microvascular Models.

CustomRegressor.py contains the modified version of MONAI's Regressor model, where we modified the last layer to ensure the output is between 0 and 1.

More details can be found in our paper.
